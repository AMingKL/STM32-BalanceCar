 - project .cproject/.project: A pre-configured project file with the provided 
                               library structure that produces an executable 
                               image with TrueSTUDIO.

 - stm32_flash.ld: 			       This file is the TrueSTUDIO linker script used to 
                               place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH 
                               and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal 
                               SRAM. 
                               You can customize this file to your need.
                           
 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
 - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace 
   directory.
 - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
   and then click "Next". 
 - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory and select the project: 
   - STM32100E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density Value 
     line devices.
 - Under Windows->Preferences->General->Workspace->Linked Resources, add 
   a variable path named "CurPath" which points to the folder containing
   "Libraries", "Project" and "Utilities" folders.
 - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
   window then click on Project->build project menu.
 - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
   Run->Debug (F11)

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
