@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the JTAG IOs as standard 
GPIOs and gives a configuration sequence. 

First, the SWJ-DP is disabled. The SWJ-DP pins are configured as output push-pull.
Five LEDs connected to the PA.13(JTMS/SWDAT), PA.14(JTCK/SWCLK), PA.15(JTDI), 
PB.03(JTDO) and PB.04(JTRST) pins are toggled in an infinite loop.

Note that once the JTAG IOs are disabled, the connection with the host debugger is
lost and cannot be re-established as long as the JTAG IOs remain disabled. 

To avoid this situation, a specified pin is connected to a push-button that is used
to disable or not the JTAG IOs:
 1. push-button pressed at reset: JTAG IOs disabled	and LED1 turned on
 2. push-button not pressed at reset: JTAG IOs unchanged and LED2 turned on

Before starting this example, you should disconnect your tool chain debugging probe
and run the example in standalone mode.
