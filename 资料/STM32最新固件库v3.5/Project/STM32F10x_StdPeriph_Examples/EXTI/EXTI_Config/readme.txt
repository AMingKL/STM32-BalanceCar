@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, 2 EXTI lines (EXTI0 and EXTI8 or EXTI9) are configured 
to generate an interrupt on each rising or falling edge. In the interrupt routine 
a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
  - EXTI0 is mapped to PA.00
  - EXTI8 is mapped to PG.08
  - EXTI9 is mapped to PB.09

After EXTI configuration, a software interrupt is generated on the EXTI0 toggles LED1.
After that,
  when rising edge is detected on EXTI0, LED1 toggles
  when falling edge is detected on EXTI8, LED2 toggles
  when falling edge is detected on EXTI9, LED2 toggles


If any STM3210XX-EVAL is used,
  when Wakeup push-button is pressed, LED1 toggles
  when Key push-button is pressed, LED2 toggles

In this example, EXTI0_Config() function can be substituted by 
STM_EVAL_PBInit(Button_WAKEUP, Mode_EXTI) and EXTI9_5_Config() by 
STM_EVAL_PBInit(Button_KEY, Mode_EXTI) provided in the STM3210XX-EVAL driver.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL 
    (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected to PF.06 and PF.07 pin
    - Use the Key push-button connected to pin PG.08 (EXTI Line8). 
    - Use the Wakeup push-button connected to pin PA.00 (EXTI Line0).
    @note  the jumper JP4 must be not fit to be able to use the Wakeup push-button
        
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected to PC.06 and PC.07 pin
