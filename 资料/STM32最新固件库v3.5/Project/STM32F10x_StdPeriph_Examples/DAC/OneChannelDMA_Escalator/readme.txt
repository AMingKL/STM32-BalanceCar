@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use one DAC channel mode with DMA to generate an
escalator signal on DAC channel1 output.

DAC channel1 conversion is configured to be triggered by TIM6 TRGO triggers and
without noise/triangle wave generation. 8bit right data alignment is selected
since we choose to access DAC_DHR8R1 register.
DMA2 channel3 is configured to transfer continuously, byte by byte, a 6-byte
buffer to the DAC1 register DAC_DHR8R1.

The transferred 6bytes buffer is made to have an escalator signal on DAC channel1
output. DAC channel1 is then enabled. Once TIM6 is enabled, each TIM6 TRGO update
event generate a DMA request which transfer data  to the DAC1 register and DAC
conversion is started. The escalator signal can be visualized by connecting PA.04
pin to an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, XL-Density,
    High-Density Value line, Medium-Density Value line and Low-Density Value 
    line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density Value line),STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density Value line),
     STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line) and STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and 
     XL-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
     supported device and development board.   

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
