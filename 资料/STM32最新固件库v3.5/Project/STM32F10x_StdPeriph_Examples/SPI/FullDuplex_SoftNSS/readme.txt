@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication between SPIy and
SPIz in full-duplex mode and performs a transfer from Master to Slave and then 
Slave to Master in the same application with software NSS management.
SPIy and SPIz can be SPI1 and SPI2 or SPI3 and SPI2, depending on the STMicroelectronics
EVAL board you are using.

Both SPIs are configured with 8bit data frame and a 9Mbit/s communication speed.
(for Value line devices the speed is set at 6Mbit/s).
In the first phase, the master SPIy starts the SPIy_Buffer_Tx transfer while the 
slave SPIz transmit SPIz_Buffer_Tx. Once the transfer is completed a comparison 
is done and TransferStatus1 and TransferStatus2 gives the data transfer status for
each data transfer direction where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data 
are the same otherwise it is FAILED.

As the NSS pin is managed by software, this permit to SPIy to become slave and SPIz
to become master without hardware modification.
In the second step, the slave SPIy starts the SPIy_Buffer_Tx transfer while the 
master SPIz transmit SPIz_Buffer_Tx. Once the transfer is completed a comparison 
is done and TransferStatus3 and TransferStatus4 gives the data transfer status for
each data transfer direction where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data 
are the same otherwise it is FAILED.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density 
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in SPI/FullDuplex_SoftNSS/platform_config.h file.  

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin	(PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MISO pin (PA.06) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MOSI pin (PB.15)
    
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin	(PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MISO pin (PA.06) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MOSI pin (PB.15)
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI3 SCK pin (PC.10) to SPI2 SCK pin	(PB.13)
    - Connect SPI3 MISO pin (PC.11) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    - Connect SPI3 MOSI pin (PC.12) to SPI2 MOSI pin (PB.15)
    @note In this case SPI3 pins are remapped by software.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin	(PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MISO pin (PA.06) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MOSI pin (PB.15)
    @note The jumper 14 (USB Disconnect) must be set in position 1<->2 in order
          to not interfer with SPI2 MISO pin PB14.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin	(PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MISO pin (PA.06) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MOSI pin (PB.15)
