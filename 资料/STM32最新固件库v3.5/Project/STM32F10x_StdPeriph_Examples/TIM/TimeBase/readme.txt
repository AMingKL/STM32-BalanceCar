@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Timing 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel in order to generate
4 different time bases.

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), to get TIM2 counter 
clock at 6 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices and to 24 MHz for Low-Density Value line,
Medium-Density Value line and High-Density devices.

The TIM2 CC1 register value is equal to 40961, 
CC1 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 146.48 Hz,
so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates an interrupt each 6.8ms

The TIM2 CC2 register is equal to 27309, 
CC2 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 219.7 Hz
so the TIM2 Channel 2 generates an interrupt each 4.55ms

The TIM2 CC3 register is equal to 13654, 
CC3 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 439.4Hz
so the TIM2 Channel 3 generates an interrupt each 2.27ms

The TIM2 CC4 register is equal to 6826, 
CC4 update rate = TIM2 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  878.9 Hz
so the TIM2 Channel 4 generates an interrupt each 1.13ms.

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, 4 pins(PC.06, PC.07,
PC.08 and  PC.09) are toggled with the following frequencies: 

- PC.06: 73.24Hz (CC1)
- PC.07: 109.8Hz (CC2)
- PC.08: 219.7Hz (CC3) 
- PC.09: 439.4Hz (CC4)

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32100E-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL, STM32100E-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect an oscilloscope on PC.06, PC.07, PC.08 and  PC.09 to show the 
      different Time Base signals.  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
