@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM3 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different frequencies.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and we want to get TIM3
counter clock at 12 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices and to 24 MHz for Low-Density Value line,
Medium-Density Value line and High-Density devices.

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 32768: 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 366.2 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 183.1 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR2 register is equal to 16384:
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 732.4 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 366.3 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR3 register is equal to 8192:
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 1464.8 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 732.4 Hz.

The TIM3 CCR4 register is equal to 4096:
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  2929.6 Hz
so the TIM3 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1464.8 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins(TIM3 full remapped pins) to an oscilloscope to monitor 
      the different waveforms:
       - PC.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PC.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PC.08 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PC.09 (TIM3_CH4)

  - STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL, STM32100E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PA.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PA.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PB.00 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PB.01 (TIM3_CH4) 
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
