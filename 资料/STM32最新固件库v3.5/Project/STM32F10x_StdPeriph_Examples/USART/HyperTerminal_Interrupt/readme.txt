@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM1 Transmit and Receive 
interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.
EVAL_COM1 can be USART1 or USART2 depending on the STMicroelectronics EVAL board
you are using.

First, the EVAL_COM1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.
The string that you have entered is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive
buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as maximum (the reception is stopped when this
maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN10 and PC serial port.  

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN6 and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumpers JP19 and JP18 are open.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN12 and PC serial port.

    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN6 and PC serial port.  

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN10 and PC serial port. 
           
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
