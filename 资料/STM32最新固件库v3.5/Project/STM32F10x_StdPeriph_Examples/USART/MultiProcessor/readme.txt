@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the USART in multi-processor mode.
USARTy and USARTz can be USART1 and USART2 or USART2 and USART3 respectively, 
depending on the STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

First, the USARTy and USARTz address are set to 0x1 and 0x2. The USARTy send 
continuously the character 0x33 to the USARTz. The USARTz toggle LED1, LED2, LED3 
and LED4 pins while receiving 0x33.

When a falling edge is applied on BUTTON_KEY EXTI line, an interrupt is generated
and in the EXTI9_5_IRQHandler routine, the USARTz is entered in mute mode and still
in this mode (no LED toggling) until a rising edge is applied on BUTTON_WAKEUP 
EXTI Line 0.
In this interrupt routine the USARTy send the character of address mark (0x102)
to wakeup USARTz. The LED restart toggling.

USARTy and USARTz configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
  - Word Length = 9 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in USART/MultiProcessor/platform_config.h or stm32_eval.h file.
