@par Example Description 

This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using USARTx.
USARTx can be USART1 or USART2 depending on the EVAL board you are using.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN10 and PC serial port.
     
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
     CN10 and PC serial port.  

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN6 (USART2) and PC serial port.
    @note Make sure that jumpers JP19 and JP18 are open.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN12(when USART1 is used) and PC serial port.   
   
  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN6(when USART1 is used) and PC serial port.
	 
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example 

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
