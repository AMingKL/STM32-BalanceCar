@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the FSMC firmware library and
an associate driver to perform erase/read/write operations on the M29W128FL,
M29W128GL or S29GL128P NOR memories mounted on the STM3210E-EVAL board.

@par Directory contents 

  - FSMC/NOR/stm32f10x_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - FSMC/NOR/stm32f10x_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - FSMC/NOR/stm32f10x_it.h      Header for stm32f10x_it.c
  - FSMC/NOR/main.c              Main program
  - FSMC/NOR/system_stm32f10x.c  STM32F10x system source file  

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F10x High-Density and XL-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) evaluation board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example 

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.   
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
