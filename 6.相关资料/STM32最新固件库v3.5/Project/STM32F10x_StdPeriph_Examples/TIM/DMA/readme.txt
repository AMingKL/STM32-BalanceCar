@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use DMA with TIM1 Update request
to transfer Data from memory to TIM1 Capture Compare Register3.

TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices. For Low-Density Value line, Medium-Density and
High-Density Value line devices, SystemCoreClock is set to 24 MHz.

The objective is to configure TIM1 channel 3 to generate complementary PWM
signal with a frequency equal to 17.57 KHz:
   - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1
and a variable duty cycle that is changed by the DMA after a specific number of
Update DMA request.

The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIM1 Repetion counter,
each 3 Update Requests, the TIM1 Channel 3 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
value defined by the SRC_Buffer.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32100E-EVAL, STM32100B-EVAL, STM3210C-EVAL, STM3210E-EVAL, STM32100E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:  
        - TIM1 CH3  (PA.10)
        - TIM1 CH3N (PB.15)  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example 

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
