@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use DAC dual channel mode with DMA to generate sine
waves on both DAC channels outputs.

Both DAC channels conversions are configured to be triggered by TIM2 TRGO triggers
and without noise/triangle wave generation. 12bit right data alignment is selected
since we choose to access DAC_DHR12RD register. DMA2 channel4 is configured to
transfer continuously, word by word, a 32-word buffer to the dual DAC register
DAC_DHR12RD.

The transferred 32buffer is made to have a sine wave generation on each DAC channel 
output. Both DAC channels are then enabled. Only DAC channel2 DMA capability is enabled.

Once TIM2 is enabled, each TIM2 TRGO update event generate a DMA request which
transfer data to the dual DAC register and DAC conversion is started. The sine
waves can be visualized by connecting both PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density
    Value line, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line and Low-Density Value line 
    Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL 
    (High-Density Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), 
    STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line) and STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope 
    
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope 
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up  
    - Only PA.04 can be monitored on an oscilloscope, PA.05 is used by other
      module (Motor control connector) that prevents to have DAC channel output
      on it. However, if you don't use Motor control connector, you can remove
      the 0ohm resistor R84 and thus PA.05 can be used for DAC output.
    @note Make shure that jumper JP15 is open.
        
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PA.04 and PA.05 pins to an oscilloscope    

    
@par How to use it ?
