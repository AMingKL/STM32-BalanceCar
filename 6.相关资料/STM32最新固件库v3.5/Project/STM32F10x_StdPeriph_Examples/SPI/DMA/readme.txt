@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication between the two
SPIs in simplex mode and performs a transfer from SPI_MASTER in polling mode to the
SPI_SLAVE in DMA receive mode. 

SPI_MASTER and SPI_SLAVE can be SPI1 and SPI2 or SPI3 and SPI2, depending on the
STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

Both SPIs are configured with 8bit data frame and a 18Mbit/s communication speed.
SPI_MASTER is configured in bidirectional mode as transmitter only, while SPI_SLAVE
is configured in bidirectional mode but as receiver only. Both master and slave NSS
pins are managed by hardware.
A dedicated DMA channel is configured for SPI_SLAVE Rx request to store received
data in SPI_SLAVE_Buffer_Rx. 

SPI_MASTER starts by transferring the first data, once this data is received by the
SPI_SLAVE the RxNE request will trigger the DMA to transfer this data and store it
into SPI_SLAVE_Buffer_Rx. The same action is done for the rest of the buffer.

Once the transfer is completed a comparison is done and TransferStatus gives the
data transfer status where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data are the
same otherwise it is FAILED.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity
    line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.
    This example can't be tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    High-Density Value line) and STM32100B-EVAL (STM32F10x Medium-Density Value line) 
    evaluation boards. To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to 
    run the example,uncomment the corresponding line in SPI/DMA/platform_config.h file.  

  
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI2 NSS pin (PB.12) to SPI3 NSS pin	(PA.04)
    - Connect SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13) to SPI3 SCK pin (PC.10)
    - Connect SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14) to SPI3 MOSI pin (PC.12)
    @note In this case SPI3 pins are remapped by software.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI2 NSS pin (PB.12) to SPI1 NSS pin (PA.04)
    - Connect SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13) to SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05)
    - Connect SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14) to SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07)
    @note The jumper 14 (USB Disconnect) must be set in position 1<->2 in order
          to not interfer with SPI2 MISO pin PB14.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI2 NSS pin (PB.12) to SPI1 NSS pin (PA.04)
    - Connect SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13) to SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05)
    - Connect SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14) to SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07)
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
