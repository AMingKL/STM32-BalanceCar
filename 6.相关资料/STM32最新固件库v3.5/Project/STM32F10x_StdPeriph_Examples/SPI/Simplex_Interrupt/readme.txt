@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication between two
SPIs in simplex mode and performs a data buffer transfer from SPI_MASTER to
SPI_SLAVE using TxE interrupt for master and RxNE interrupt for slave.
SPI_MASTER and SPI_SLAVE can be SPI1 and SPI2 or SPI3 and SPI2, depending on the
STMicroelectronics EVAL board you are using.

Both SPIs are configured with 8bit data frame and a 9Mbit/s communication speed
(for Value line devices the communication speed is set to 3Mbit/s).
The TxE interrupt is enabled for the master and the RxNE interrupt is enabled for
the slave.

Once both SPIs are enabled, first TxE interrupt is generated for the master
and in its interrupt service routine the first data is sent from SPI_MASTER_Buffer_Tx. 
Once this data is received by the slave the RxNE interrupt is generated and in
the routine this data is stored in the SPI_SLAVE_Buffer_Rx.

The same procedure is followed for the remaining SPI_MASTER_Buffer_Tx data.
Once all data buffer are received by the slave the TxE interrupt is disabled.
A comparison is done and TransferStatus variable gives the data transfer status
where it is PASSED if transmitted and received data are the same otherwise it is FAILED.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density 
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in SPI/Simplex_Interrupt/platform_config.h file.  

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI3 SCK pin (PC.10) to SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13)
    - Connect SPI3 MOSI pin (PC.12) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    @note In this case SPI3 pins are remapped by software.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
    @note The jumper 14 (USB Disconnect) must be set in position 1<->2 in order
          to not interfer with SPI2 MISO pin PB14.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PA.05) to SPI2 SCK pin (PB.13)
    - Connect SPI1 MOSI pin (PA.07) to SPI2 MISO pin (PB.14)
