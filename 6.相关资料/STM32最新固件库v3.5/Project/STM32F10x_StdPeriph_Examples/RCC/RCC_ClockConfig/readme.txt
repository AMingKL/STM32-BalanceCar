@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the System clock(SYSCLK) to have different
frequencies: 24MHz, 36MHz, 48MHz, 56MHz and 72MHz (common frequencies that covers
the major of the applications). 
The SYSCLK frequency is selected by user in main.h file.

It shows how to use, for debug purpose, the RCC_GetClocksFreq function to retrieve
the current status and frequencies of different on chip clocks. You can see the
RCC_ClockFreq structure content, which hold the frequencies of different on chip
clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

This example handles also the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection:
when the HSE clock disappears (broken or disconnected external Quartz); HSE, PLL
are disabled (but no change on PLL config), HSI selected as system clock source
and an interrupt (NMI) is generated. In the NMI ISR, the HSE, HSE ready interrupt
are enabled and once HSE clock recover, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and in
the RCC ISR routine the system clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before
HSE clock failure). You can monitor the HSE clock on the MCO pin (PA.08).

Four LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@note To adjust the External High Speed oscillator (HSE) Startup Timeout value,
use HSEStartUp_TimeOut variable defined in the stm32f10x.h file.
