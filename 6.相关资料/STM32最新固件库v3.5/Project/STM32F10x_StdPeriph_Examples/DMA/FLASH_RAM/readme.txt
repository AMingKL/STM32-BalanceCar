@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer 
a word data buffer from FLASH memory to embedded SRAM memory.

DMA1 Channel6 is configured to transfer the contents of a 32-word data buffer
stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA1 Channel6 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA1 Channel6.
At the end of the transfer a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled. Once interrupt is generated, the remaining data to be transferred is
read which must be equal to 0. The Transfer Complete Interrupt pending bit is
then cleared. A comparison between the source and destination buffers is done to
check that all data have been correctly transferred.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    XL-Density,High-Density Value line, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density
    Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density 
    and XL-Density), STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density Value line) and STM3210B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example 

@note
 - Low-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where the 
   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - XL-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 512 and 1024 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
