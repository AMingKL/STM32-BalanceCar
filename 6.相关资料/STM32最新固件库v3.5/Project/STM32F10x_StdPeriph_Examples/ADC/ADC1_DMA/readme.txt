@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel14.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the ADCConvertedValue variable.
The ADC1 clock is set to 12 MHz on Value line devices and to 14MHz on other 
devices.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL 
    (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and 
    STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV2)
      
  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel14 mapped on pin PC.04
      (potentiometer RV1)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

   Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.  
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx, STM32F102xx and STM32F103xx 
   microcontrollers where the Flash memory density ranges between 64 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - High-density Value line devices are STM32F100xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
