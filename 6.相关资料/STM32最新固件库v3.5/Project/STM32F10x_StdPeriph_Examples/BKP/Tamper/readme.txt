@par Example Description 

This example shows how to write/read data to/from Backup data registers and 
demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

The associated firmware performs the following:

1. It configures the ANTI_TAMP pin to be active low, and enables the Tamper interrupt.

2. It writes the data to all Backup data registers, then check whether the data were
correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns on, otherwise LED2 turns on.

3. On applying a low level on the ANTI_TAMP pin (PC.13), the Backup data registers
are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. The corresponding ISR then checks
whether the Backup data registers are cleared. If yes, LED3 on, otherwise LED4
turns on.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density, 
    High-Density Value line, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density 
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL 
    (Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL 
    (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

  - STM32100B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, 
      PC.08 and PC.09 pins
    - Use the Tamper push-button connected to pin PC.13. PC13 is already 
      connected to VDD on the eval board.
    
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PD.07, PD.13, PF.03
      and PD.04 pins  
    - Use the Tamper push-button connected to pin PC.13 (set jumper JP1 in position 2-3). 
      PC13 is already connected to VDD on the eval board.
    
  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, 
      PF.08 and PF.09 pins
    - Use the Tamper push-button connected to pin PC.13. PC13 is already 
      connected to VDD on the eval board.   

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, 
      PC.08 and PC.09 pins
    - Use the Tamper push-button connected to pin PC.13. PC13 is already 
      connected to VDD on the eval board.
	  
  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, 
      PF.08 and PF.09 pins
    - Use the Tamper push-button connected to pin PC.13. PC13 is already 
      connected to VDD on the eval board.
